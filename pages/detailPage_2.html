    <h2>The Memory Collective</h2>
</div>

<div class="info_p">
    <p>The founder of the company, Kara Long, lost both her brother and father when she was a young girl. She soon started to forget the memories she believed would last forever. The process of losing memories was something she didn't want anyone else to experience. As part of our mission, we developed an app that allows people to preserve memories for themselves in a time-efficient and affordable manner. This would also allow for interconnectivity between users so that peopleâ€™s legacies and memories could be passed down. </p>
