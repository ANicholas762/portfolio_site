    <p>Hi, I'm Antera.</p>
    <p>
        I am a front-end developer and UI/UX designer. As a senior at Indiana University, I am completing my Bachelor of Science degree with a specialization in Web Design and Development from the Luddy School of Informatics  Computing, and Engineering. I will also be receiving a minor in Philosophy and Informatics. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        I have always been interested in web design and development, but as I learned about UI/UX this past year it seemed to be the best kind of creative work for me since there aren't many other options like that in the tech industries.  I look forward to working on more amazing projects and continuing my work.

    </p>
